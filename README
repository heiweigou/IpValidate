A tiny PHP library for validating and matching IPv4 addresses and network ranges

You can use this little library to:

 - Validate IPv4 addresses written in dotted-decimal notation (a.b.c.d)
 - Validate IPv4 network ranges written in different formats (CIDR and others) 
 - Match an IPv4 address against a network range
 - Get information like broadcast address and network address out of an IPv4
   network range

Currently no IPv6 support is planned.

This has been written in PHP 5.2 style (PSR-0 namespaces etc.) a long time ago. It 
may be converted to PHP 5.3 standards some day. 

IpValidate is released under the terms of the DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO 
PUBLIC LICENSE version 2.0. See COPYING for details.
